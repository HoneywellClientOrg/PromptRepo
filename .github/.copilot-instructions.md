# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions

## What kind of coding style do you prefer?

Use clean and minimal HTML. When working with p5.js:
- Always include the latest p5.js CDN in the `<head>`.
- Keep all script logic inside a `<script>` tag in the same HTML file unless otherwise specified.
- Use `setup()` for initialization and `draw()` for rendering.
- Prefer `createCanvas(400, 400)` unless otherwise asked.
- Use readable coordinates and color codes (e.g., `fill(255, 0, 0)` for red).

## What language or frameworks do you use?

HTML + p5.js (a JavaScript framework for creative drawing).  
The goal is to produce visual sketches such as houses, nature scenes, and interactive visuals using p5.js.

## What do you want to build with Copilot?

I want to:
- Create full HTML pages that embed p5.js sketches.
- Generate creative scenes like a white house with a red door and windows.
- Run and test sketches in the browser.
- Use descriptive prompts to build visual artwork step by step.

## Any other preferences?

- Always wrap HTML code in a full structure with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- When outputting p5.js examples, comment each shape or object (e.g., “// Draw roof”).
- Use indentation and simple structure to make the code beginner-friendly.
- No need for external CSS or JS files unless explicitly required.
- Azure Keyvault service name should always starts with MVS-HW-KV and increment the number by 1 for each new service.
